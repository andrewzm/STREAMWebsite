**Andrew Zammit-Mangion** · *Associate Professor, Group Lead (UNSW)*

Andrew Zammit-Mangion is an Associate Professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at UNSW Sydney. His research interests lie in spatio-temporal modelling and the computational tools that enable it. His work spans variational Bayesian methods for spatio-temporal models, large-scale data fusion, and nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal modelling. Since 2018, he has focused on deep learning methods in spatio-temporal statistics under an ARC Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA). He is currently Chief Investigator on ARC projects on greenhouse gas source-sink estimation, Securing Antarctica's Environmental Future (SAEF), and the TIDE Industrial Transformation Research Hub, where he also serves as Data Science Coordinator.

**Lachlan Astfalck** · *Lecturer (UNSW)*

Lachlan Astfalck is a Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at UNSW Sydney with interests in both methodological and applied research. Methodologically his work focuses on physically constrained spatio-temporal systems, spectral analysis, distributed Bayesian inference, emulation of engineering computer models, and uncertainty quantification in general. His applied research spans all things water: oceanography, hydrodynamics, hydrology and glaciology. He is a current CI on an ARC DP on modelling heat-wave events on the Ningaloo Reef. Previously, he was a Research Fellow in the ARC TIDE ITRH at UWA where he worked on translating modern statistical learning methodology into engineering practice. He has also worked as a Research Fellow at Leeds University where he worked on uncertainty quantification in paleo-climate glaciology.

**Aishwarya Bhaskaran** · *Lecturer (UNSW)*

Aishwarya Bhaskaran is a Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at UNSW Sydney. Her research primarily focuses on survival analysis and generalized linear mixed models, with particular emphasis on semi-parametric survival regression, penalised methods, likelihood-based inference and asymptotic theory. Her work also spans methodological development and applications across diverse domains, including complex medical datasets such as advanced melanoma. In this context, she collaborates closely with medical researchers to develop statistically rigorous methods with strong predictive performance. She received her PhD from the University of Technology Sydney, where her doctoral work examined likelihood theory and methods for generalized linear mixed models. She subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Macquarie University, where she further developed high-predictive-performance methodology through semi-parametric Cox and accelerated failure time models.

**Yan Gong** · *Lecturer (UNSW)*

Yan Gong is currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science at MBZUAI. Her research interests include developing and applying modern statistical methodologies to address complex, real-world problems in financial risk, extreme weather events, and public health. Her work spans statistics of extremes, spatial statistics, causal inference, Bayesian inference, and deep learning. Prior to joining MBZUAI, she held postdoctoral positions at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Imperial College London. She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from KAUST in 2023, under the supervision of Professor Raphaël Huser. She currently serves as a founding organizer of the Spatio-Temporal Statistics and Data Science Community (STSDS), an international network advancing research in spatio-temporal statistics and data science.

**Pratik Nag** · *Research Fellow (UOW)*

Pratik Nag is a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Applied Statistical Research Australia (NIASRA), University of Wollongong, where he works with Prof. Noel Cressie, Prof. Andrew Zammit Mangion, and Prof. Sumeetpal Singh. His research focuses on dynamic spatio-temporal modeling for noisy and incomplete data, with particular emphasis on Fourier Neural Operators and the development of fully Bayesian frameworks for high-dimensional models. He completed his PhD at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Prof. Ying Sun. His broader research interests lie in the development of advanced statistical and machine learning methodologies, especially for predictive modeling and uncertainty quantification. He is particularly interested in coupling neural networks with traditional statistical paradigms to develop efficient, data-driven solutions to real-world problems, and is deeply motivated to explore innovative approaches to addressing complex challenges in modern data science.
